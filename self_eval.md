# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods? Not too confident I need to do more practice on it
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? I can do the simple methods but the complicated ones I always get stuck on
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
I just need to practice more I don't have any question
